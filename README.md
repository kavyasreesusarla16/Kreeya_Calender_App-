## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

This project is still a **work in progress**. I was able to set up the base structure, environment configs, Supabase integration, and began work on Google Calendar and Cohere API.

Due to limited time, full integration wasn‚Äôt completed ‚Äî but this reflects my genuine effort and willingness to learn.
